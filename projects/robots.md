# Overview
These are random robots i made through undergrad for either academic or recreational reasons.

# X. Planetary Gear Robot
## X.1: Overview and Robot Task
For 2.007 Design and Manufacturing I, several tasks are given for robots and students are free to design their robots to accomplish them. The robot is designed to turn a benzene ring with three attachment points at their centers (see picture.)

## X.: Required Torque
Measuring the force using a spring scale and the distance from the center of rotation, the required torque was calculated at

## X.3: Testing
At first, the system was completely made of acrylic plastic. Taking a 0.25 inch plastic sheet and laser cutting it, the first set of gears was made. Material choice being acrylic plastic was due to the low friction the gears face as they grind against each other.

Then, testing the system, it works and exerts enough torque to turn. However, the sun and planet gears cracked with continious use, pointing to the need for less rigidity and more durable material.
