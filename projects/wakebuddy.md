summary: "My team developed a tow rope for beginner water skiers."
---

My main job was the monitor housing. Implementing two rounds of design reviews and an assembly review, I designed (in SOLIDWORKS) and assisted with manufacturing of the inner housing and user interface. The main obstacle was fitting the electronics into the limited space inside a purchased waterproof box. 

In terms of team organizing, I was resposible for making sure colleagues were comfortable in their workspace and in team meetings. Some tasks include biweekly checkin meetings, ensuring all tasks are attended for, and collecting feedback and communicate them to the team.
