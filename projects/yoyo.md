# Overview

<div class="text-center float-end p-4">
  My team designed and manufactured 100 glow-in-the-dark yoyos for MIT 2.008: Design and Manufacturing II. Design was planned and reworked each yoyo batch. Final design included three injection molded pieces and one thermoformed piece press fit onto a bearing.

# 1. Design
The molds were CNC'd on a mill using aluminum. The CAD for the design is shown below. After, the molds were designed and reworked three times to account for clearance and manufacturing variation. The design is inspired by planetary system rotation. As such, the main aspects have to do with *glow* and *rotation*. The design is intended to:
- Glow in the dark.
- The center piece rotates independantly of the yoyo.
For glow in the dark, we are using glow in the dark plastic pallets. Added to the plain plastic pallets with a 20% mass ratio, this makes the centerpiece glow in dim lighting.
To make the centerpiece rotate independently, it is press fit onto a bearing that is also press fit onto the bottom piece. 
## 1.1. CAD
The overall design includes four pieces:
- Bottom piece
- Top piece
- Centerpiece
- Thermoformed cover

# 2. Manufacturing
The main steps of manufacturing have two processes: Injection molding and thermoforming

## 2.1 Injection Molding
a HASS CNC Mill was used to mill out the molds from 4"x4"x1.5" aluminum blocks. The molds were then used in a BOY A22 injection molding machine for mass manufacturing.

## 2.2 Thermoforming
A simple mold was made that is similar to a hockey puck but with holes for creating vaccum suction.

100 yoyos were manufactured. This means 200 yoyo halves press fit into a bearing.
