summary: "My team designed and manufactured 100 glow-in-the-dark yoyos. Design was planned and reworked each yoyo batch. Final design included three injection molded pieces and one thermoformed piece press fit onto a bearing."
---
The molds were CNC'd on a mill using aluminum. The CAD for the design is shown below. After, the molds were designed and reworked three times to account for clearance and manufacturing variation.

100 yoyos were manufactured. This means 200 yoyo halves press fit into a bearing.
